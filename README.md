A lightning-fast, voice-first inventory management system designed to replace traditional pen-and-paper ledgers (*bahi-khatas*) for shopkeepers and small businesses.

BolKhata prioritizes extreme low latency, ensuring the AI can process Hindi/Hinglish voice commands, display structured transaction receipts, and securely update the cloud database — just as fast as a shopkeeper can write it down.

## Key Features

- **Zero-Latency Voice Capture:** Press-and-hold walkie-talkie UI with spacebar desktop support — designed for noisy shop environments.
- **Dialect & Hinglish Support:** Powered by Groq Whisper-Large-V3 to accurately transcribe heavily accented Hindi/Hinglish speech without hallucinating.
- **Intelligent Intent Extraction:** Llama 3 (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) instantly translates Devanagari to English, maps local slang (e.g., "Colgate" → "toothpaste"), and understands complex multi-item orders in a single breath.
- **Multi-Tenant Security:** Firebase Auth (Phone/OTP, Google, Email) ensures every shopkeeper's inventory and history is strictly siloed and private.
- **Udhaar (Credit) Management:** Automatically routes items to a customer's credit ledger when a name is spoken — *"Do lux Ramesh ke khaate mein likh do."*
- **Smart Dashboard & History:** Cleanly formatted tables for every transaction, with a sliding drawer keeping track of the last 50 transactions for easy auditing.
- **Progressive Web App:** Installable on mobile and desktop with offline shell caching, home screen icon, and standalone app mode — no app store required.
