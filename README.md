A lightning-fast, voice-first inventory management system designed to replace traditional pen-and-paper ledgers (*bahi-khatas*) for shopkeepers and small businesses.

BolKhata prioritizes extreme low latency, ensuring the AI can process Hindi/Hinglish voice commands, display structured transaction receipts, and securely update the cloud database — just as fast as a shopkeeper can write it down.

## Key Features

- **Zero-Latency Voice Capture:** Press-and-hold walkie-talkie UI with spacebar desktop support — designed for noisy shop environments.
- **Dialect & Hinglish Support:** Powered by Groq Whisper-Large-V3 to accurately transcribe heavily accented Hindi/Hinglish speech without hallucinating.
- **Intelligent Intent Extraction:** Llama 3 (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) instantly translates Devanagari to English, extracts contextual customer modifiers (e.g., "Delhi wale Ramesh" vs "Park wale Ramesh"), and understands complex multi-item orders in a single breath.
- **Dynamic Fuzzy Matching:** No hardcoded aliases! The system instantly fetches your live inventory and fuzzy-matches spoken slang or errors to your exact stored items, automatically adapting as you add new stock.
- **Customer Order & Udhaar Tracking:** Seamlessly separates general orders (*"Ramesh Delhi ko bech diya"*) from credit ledgers (*"Ramesh Delhi ke khate me likh do"*). Query specific customer histories using their exact differentiating context.
- **Multi-Tenant Security:** Firebase Auth (Phone/OTP, Google, Email) ensures every shopkeeper's inventory and history is strictly siloed and private.
- **Smart Dashboard & History:** Cleanly formatted tables for every transaction, with a sliding drawer keeping track of the last 50 transactions for easy auditing.
- **Progressive Web App:** Installable on mobile and desktop with offline shell caching, home screen icon, and standalone app mode — no app store required.
